WORK EXPERIENCE: 
BAR MANAGER, FIVE EASY PIECES, BOHEMIAN GROVE, MONTE RIO/SAN
FRANCISCO, CA 10/2015-present

Bohemian Club throughout the year in San Francisco.

-Wrote 5 different cocktail menus specifically tailored and curated for my clients at the Bohemian Grove; all menus included in attachments, 
-Assisted in all sorts of tasks, most of which required quick thinking on my feet, from tracking down coolers full of chilean sea bass lost in a giant central fridge in the middle of the woods to save a meal for our members, to making sure another members' priceless bottles of wine are served at just the right moment.
-Directed a team of tree climbers in the Grove to properly erect our camps' sun shades -- a set of 5 shades that were architectually designed to block the sun, roped off in the trees. There was only one correct arrangment for the shades, with hundreds of possibilities of how they could be erected. I supplanted the foremen of the tree climbers, and made it happen with only a picture on my phone of the original arrangment of the shades.
-Was available for cocktails/beers/wine/sandwiches/musical entertainment/assistance with our camps PA sound system at any time of the day or night, for approximately 30 days out of the year for our members at the Bohemian Grove.
-Performed Victor Wooten's arrangment of 'Norweigen Wood' on the deck of 5 Easy Pieces
-Was able to comfortabley live, somehow, with 3 other guys in bunk beds in a tiny room behind the kitchen in the middle of the Redwoods for a whole month without hassle or drama. A PEOPLE PERSON.
-Recommended my successor, needed due to back injuries, wild success
-basically ran a 5 star hotel in the middle of the Redwoods with 3 other guys and zero phone reception. Our camp sleeps about 32, and most of our meal events would be for around 50.
